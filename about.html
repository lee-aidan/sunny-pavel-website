          <p>
            I was born and raised in Bolinas, a small coastal town in California,
            and that landscape helped shape my music. I strive to write evocative,
            meaningful originals that feel natural and relatable. As a primarily
            solo acoustic guitarist and vocalist, I love pairing meaningful lyrics
            with corresponding guitar work to create vivid imagery.
          </p>

          <p>
            My style has been deeply shaped by artists such as John Mayer,
            Coldplay, James Taylor, and Dire Straits. When I perform, my goal is
            to create an intimate atmosphere through smooth vocals and detailed
            playing. In my sets, I blend a mix of my own original songs with
            unique, stripped-back arrangements of the classics we all know and
            love.

        <p>
          I’ve built a repertoire that is versatile and wide-ranging. I love the
          folk and singer-songwriter staples from James Taylor, Neil Young, and
          Fleetwood Mac, and lean into some modern favorites by John Mayer,
          Coldplay, Jack Johnson, and more. I also draw classics from the likes
          of Elton John, Van Morrison, Amy Winehouse, The Beatles.
        </p>

        <p>
          I aim to deliver a professional, engaging performance tailored to
          diverse audiences and event needs. I curate setlists to create an
          accessible and feel-good atmosphere. Utilizing the familiar classics,
          mixing in modern tunes, and including originals to keep the
          performance fresh.

        <p>
          To make things as easy as possible for venues and hosts, I am a fully
          self-contained act. I provide my own professional sound system (PA),
          including all microphones, stands, cables, and mixing equipment. This
          ensures a quick, seamless setup and high-quality, reliable sound for
          any space—from intimate lounges to outdoor events.
