# Sunny Pavel Website

This repository contains the source code for the official Sunny Pavel artist website. It is a fully static site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on layout, visual hierarchy, and custom interaction rather than external frameworks or site builders.

This was the second website I have ever developed. After building my first project with a heavier focus on functionality, this site gave me the opportunity to go deeper into the stylistic side of web development. I spent more time experimenting with typography, spacing, scroll behavior, and responsive design to better understand how visual choices affect user experience.
